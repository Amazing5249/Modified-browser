systems then you can download the old systems on the older repository. WE ARE NOT SUPPORTING THEM ANY LONGER! use at your own risk... 

what version 3.0 brings: 
1. a new browser interface that is fresh

much faster

some apps come native! this includes:

UBlock Orgin (add Blocker)
Add Chrome Extencions

and the unblocker its self! (same as used in firefox versions)
